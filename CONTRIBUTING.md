Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cassandra! 
We welcome and appreciate your contributions!  This short
guide aims to provide hints to make the process as quick
and painless as possible.

Getting started
===============

You can contribute to the development of Cassandra by:

- **Solving an issue listed in the GitHub issue tracker**. If this is the
	first time you contribute to Cassandra, we recommend going through
	the GitHub “issues” tab to find issues that interest you. Each issue
	has associated labels to help organize and prioritize the work. The label "good
	first issue" usually refers to improvement of documentation or easy changes to the codebase.
	These issues might be a good starting point for new developers. 
	Once you find something that catches your eye, please follow this guide to incorporate your
	changes in to the Cassandra public distribution.

- **Adding a new feature not included in the issue tracker**. If you would
	  like to contribute with a feature that is not mentioned in any issue
	(i.e. a new move or any other feature), please
	contact the developers using [Slack](https://cassandra-nd.slack.com/messages/general/) (preferred) or [e-mail](https://cassandra.nd.edu/index.php/about-cassandra/contributors). If your new
	addition is large, you might be asked to break down your work into small,
	single-purpose units if possible, since it is 
	hard to merge a large chunk of code. 
- **Reporting and fixing a bug**. When you find a bug in the code, please
	report it using GitHub issues (preferred) or via e-mail.  If you
	decide to use e-mail, you might be asked to
	open a GitHub issue. Cassandra 1.3 has a template
	for new issues to make it easy to create clear bug reports. 

Version control using Git and GitHub
