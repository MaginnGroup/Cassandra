This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
gas-phase 2,2-dimethylhexane (dmh) with N=150 molecules at temperature T=450K 
and volume V=(111.9 Ang)^3

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

dmh.pdb
    This file was created in Gaussview.

dmh.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dmh.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TRAPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TRAPPE parameters for dmh are available in the following 
    publication:

      M.G. Martin, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 1. United-atom description 
      of n-alkanes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998).

dmh.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dmh.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file dmh.ff in the same directory.

nvt.inp
    This input file uses the checkpoint option. It reads the volume, maximum
		displacement for translations, maximum theta for rotations and molecule 
		coordinates from the nvt.inp.chk file.

    The three types of molecule moves--translation, rotation, and regrowth--
    are equally probable.

    Thermodynamic properties are output every 10 sweeps = 1500 moves, for a
		total of 1000 sweeps.

nvt.inp.chk
    This checkpoint file was created by running 50k sweeps in the NPT ensemble,
		at N=150 molecules, P=5.63bar, and T=450K. The NVT volume was set to the 
		average volume from the last 25k sweeps of the NPT run. The center-of-mass 
		of each molecule was scaled appropriately.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nvt.inp dmh.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nvt.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nvt.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.

Averages were taken over the last 500 sweeps (50 data points). 
The average pressure is 5.48 bar.
