This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
liquid-phase water using the TIP4P/2005 model with N=600 molecules at 
temperature T=300K and volume V=(26.4 Ang)^3

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

tip4p.pdb
    This file was created by hand.

tip4p.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py tip4p.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TIP4P-2005 forcefield were manually typed into the 
		blank template. Parameters for TIP4P-2005 are available in the following 
    publication:

      J. L. F. Abascal and C. Vega. 
			A general purpose model for the condensed phases of water: TIP4P/2005. 
			J. Chem. Phys. 2005, 123, 234505.

tip4p.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py tip4p.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file tip4p.ff in the same directory.

nvt.inp
    This input file uses the checkpoint option. It reads the volume, maximum
		displacement for translations, maximum theta for rotations and molecule 
		coordinates from the nvt.inp.chk file.

    The two types of molecule moves--translation and rotation--are equally
    probable. Regrowth moves are not needed because water is a rigid molecule.

    Thermodynamic properties are output every 10 sweeps = 6000 moves, for a
		total of 100 sweeps.

nvt.inp.chk
    This checkpoint file was created by running 1M sweeps in the NPT ensemble,
		at N=600 molecules, P=1.0bar, and T=300K. The NVT volume was set to the 
		average volume from the last 500k sweeps of the NPT run. The center-of-mass 
		of each molecule was scaled appropriately.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nvt.inp tip4p.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nvt.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nvt.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
