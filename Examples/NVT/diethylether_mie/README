This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
liquid-phase diethylether (dee) with N=220 molecules at temperature T=343K 
and volume V=(34.7 Ang)^3 using the mie and mie_cut_shift options. Both
mie and mie_cut_shift option input files are provided.

UPDATES V1.2: 'LJ' in the .mcf and .inp file needs to be replaced with 'Mie' 
after fragment libraries and mcf files have been generated.

Cassandra now supports 'cut', 'cut_shift', and 'cut_tail' cut off options for
the Mie Potential.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

dee.pdb
    This file was created in Gaussview.

dee.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dee.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TRAPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TRAPPE parameters for dee are available in the following 
    publication:

      J.M. Stubbs, J.J. Potoff, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 6. United-atom description 
			for ethers, glycols, ketones and aldehydes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 108, 17596-17605 (2004).

dee.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dee.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file dee.ff in the same directory.

nvt_mie.inp 
    This input file uses the make_config option.
    
    The three types of molecule moves--translation, rotation, and regrowth--
    are equally probable.

    Thermodynamic properties are output every 10 sweeps = 2200 moves, for a
		total of 100 sweeps.

    The volume was determined by running 50k sweeps in the NPT ensemble,
		at N=220 molecules, P=4.01bar, and T=343K. The NVT volume was set to the 
		average volume from the last 25k sweeps of the NPT run.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nvt.inp dee.pdb

update
    replace 'LJ' in .mcf and .inp files with 'Mie'.

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nvt_mie.inp


III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nvt_mie.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
