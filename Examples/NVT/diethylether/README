This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
liquid-phase diethylether (dee) with N=220 molecules at temperature T=343K 
and volume V=(34.7 Ang)^3

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

dme.pdb
    This file was created in Gaussview.

dme.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dme.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TRAPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TRAPPE parameters for dme are available in the following 
    publication:

      J.M. Stubbs, J.J. Potoff, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 6. United-atom description 
			for ethers, glycols, ketones and aldehydes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 108, 17596-17605 (2004).

dme.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dme.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file dme.ff in the same directory.

nvt.inp
    This input file uses the make_config option.

    The three types of molecule moves--translation, rotation, and regrowth--
    are equally probable.

    Thermodynamic properties are output every 10 sweeps = 2200 moves, for a
		total of 100 sweeps.

    The volume was determined by running 50k sweeps in the NPT ensemble,
		at N=220 molecules, P=4.01bar, and T=343K. The NVT volume was set to the 
		average volume from the last 25k sweeps of the NPT run.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nvt.inp dme.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nvt.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nvt.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
