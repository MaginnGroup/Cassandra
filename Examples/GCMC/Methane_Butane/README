This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
a mixture of methane and butane, in gas phase, at temperature T=300K.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1.  PDB files
CH4.pdb and C4H10.pdb
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

I.2. ff files
CH4.ff and C4H10.ff
    A empty templates were created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py 'filename".pdb --ffTemplate
   
    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. 
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

I.3. mcf files
CH4.mcf and C4H10.mcf
    These files were generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py "filename".pdb

    Note that this command requires the  "ff file"  generated in  I.2  must be in the same directory.

I.4 input file
methane_butane.inp
    The value of chemical potential of each one of the species in the mixture does not follow an ideal solution. However, at first try
    you can start from the values related to an ideal solution

       mu(T,P,yi) = mu(T,P) +R*T ln(yi)

    were:
     mu(T,P,yi)  is the chemical potential of component i, in the mixture at a given temperature (T), pressure (P) and composition (yi);
     mu(T,P ) is the chemical potential of the pure component i at the same T and P.
     
    The chemical potential (mu) must be in kJ/mol.
    
    probablilites used in this example are:
    translations
    rotation
    regrowth
    insertions and deletions
    All the moviments were taken with equally probability.


I.5 Fragment info files
species1/ and species2/
    These directories were created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane_butane.inp CH4.pdb C4H10.pdb
    
II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane_butane.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files present the same name atributed in #Run_Name = methane_butane.*  Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
