This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation the adsorption of 
 the mixture of methane and butane, at temperature T=300K e P=3.45bar

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1.  For the adsorbates: methane and butane
I.1.1 PDB files
CH4.pdb and C4H10.pdb
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

I.1.2. ff files
CH4.ff and C4H10.ff
    A empty templates were created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py 'filename".pdb --ffTemplate
   
    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. 
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

I.1.3. mcf files
CH4.mcf and C4H10.mcf
    These files were generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py "filename".pdb

    Note that this command requires the  "ff file"  generated in  I.2  must be in the same directory.

I.2. For the Adsorbent: Silicalite
I.2.1. PDB file 
Si27uc.pdb

  The pdb file for the unit cell was taken from the following reference:
     D. H. Olson, G. T. Kokotailo, S. L. Lawton and W. M. Meier
     Crystal Structure and Structure-Related Properties of ZSM-5
     The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 85, No. 15, 1981

Then VMD was used to create the supercell (3x3x3).

I.2.2. ff File
Si27uc.ff
An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py Si27uc.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. All parameters were set like zero, since
    we used the custom mixing rules in order to provide the Lennard-Jones parameter proposed by: 
    Zhimei Du, George Manos,Thijs J. H. Vlugt and Berend Smit
    Mo1ecuIar SimuIation of Adsorption of Short Linear Alkanes and Their Mixtures in Silicalite
    AiChE Journal, vol 44, No 8, 1756-1764

I.2.3 MCF file
Si27uc.mcf
This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py Si27uc.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file Si27uc.ff in the same directory.

I.2.4. XYZ file
Si27uc.xyz
We used this file to start a simulation from an empty zeolite. In that case we use the #Start_Type read_old
This file was crated in two Steps:

Step 1)- Using the Software VMD 
       Humphrey, W., Dalke, A. and Schulten, K.
       VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics
       J. Molec. Graphics 1996, 14.1, 33-38

with the following commands:
> vmd Si27uc.pdb
> set all [atomselect top all]
> $all writexyz SI27uc.xyz

Step 2)- we modifify the Si27uc.xyz generated in VMD changing the first line. 
The first line must have the number of molecules of the zeolite (1) and the number of molecules of both adsorbates (0  0)

I.3 Input File
methane_butane_Si.inp
You need to prepare the input file for running a short simulation in order to generate the Fragment files for the 
three components (the zeolite and for both adsorbates: methane and butane).

Some details about the input file:

# Box_Info
number of boxes = 1
Box geometry = solid geometry (MFI has orthorhombic geometry then the box is ORTHOGONAL)
Dimensions of the box = dimensions of your "supercell" (here we used 3x3x3. Then the box size is x=60.21 y=59.76 and z=40.26)

# Chemical_Potential_Info
     This keyword "Chemical_Potential_Info" sets the chemical potential of the insertable species in the order in which 
     they appear in the # Molecule_Files
     The chemical potentials will be set arbitrarily to zero for the zeolite. Therefore you just need to enter 
     just the chemical potential for both adsorbates 
     The value of chemical potential of each one of the adsorbates. Therefore, the behaviour of the mixture in the gas 
     phase need to be evaluate in a previous simulation.

    The chemical potential (mu) must be in kJ/mol.
    
    probablilites used in this example are:
    translations
    rotation
    regrowth
    insertions and deletions
    All the moviments were taken with equally probability.

# Mixing_Rule
  In this example we used the values proposed by Du et al (1998).(complete reference in I.2.2)
  Note that the order of the species is (1=Silicalite, 2=methane and 3=butane)
  Then if you take a look in the mcf file of this components you are going to see that, by the order of apperance,
  there is 2 atoms types in the  Silicalite (Si and O); 1 atom type in the methane (CH4) and 2 atoms types in butane (CH3 and CH2). 
  Therefore, the custom parameters for the Lennard-Jones interactions  need to entered in that order:
     
   SI SI      0.00   0.0
   SI O       0.00   0.0
   SI CH4     0.00   0.0
   SI CH3     0.00   0.0
   SI CH2     0.00   0.0
   O   SI     0.00   0.0
   O  O       0.00   0.0
   O  CH4    96.50   3.6
   O  CH3    80.00   3.6
   O  CH2    58.00   3.6
   CH4 SI     0.00   0.0
   CH4 O     96.50   3.6
   CH4 CH4  148.00   3.73
   CH4 CH3  120.49   3.75
   CH4 CH2   83.40   3.83
   CH3 SI     0.00   0.0
   CH3 O     80.00   3.6
   CH3 CH4  120.49   3.75
   CH3 CH3   98.10   3.77
   CH3 CH2   67.90   3.85
   CH2 SI     0.00   0.0
   CH2 O     58.00   3.6
   CH2 CH4   83.40   3.83
   CH2 CH3   67.90   3.85
   CH2 CH2   47.0    3.93

I.4 Fragment info files
species1/  species2/ ans species3/
    These directories were created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane_butane_Si.inp Si27uc.pdb 
        CH4.pdb C4H10.pdb
    
     Note that like butane has two fragments the directory species3/ presents 2 directories: frag1/ and frag2/


II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane_butane_Si.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files present the same name atributed in #Run_Name = methane_butane_Si.*  
We did not provided the LOG file for this example, since due to the size of the supercell (7776 atoms) the
file is too big (around 3 GB). When you run your simulation be sure to have enough space.

Please see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
