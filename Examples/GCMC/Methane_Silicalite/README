This directory contains all the information to craeate the files needed to run a short simulation of 
adsorption of methane (from the gas phase) in Silicalite at temperature T=300K and P=0.3bar. 
In that pressure and temperature nitrogen has a chemical potential of kJ/mol (from a previous GCMC simulation in gas phase)

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1.  For the adsorbate: methane
CH4.pdb 
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

CH4.ff 
    A empty templates was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

CH4.mcf 
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb

    Note that this command requires the CH4.ff  must be in the same directory.


I.2. For the adsorbent: Silicalite
Si27ucEM.pdb

  The pdb file for the unit cell was taken from the following reference:
     D. H. Olson, G. T. Kokotailo, S. L. Lawton and W. M. Meier
     Crystal Structure and Structure-Related Properties of ZSM-5 
     The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 85, No. 15, 1981

Then VDM was used to create the supercell (3x3x3).
  
Si27ucEM.ff
An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py Si27ucEM.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used for the Si and O atoms  are available in the following reference:

    Edward J. Maginn, Alexis T. Bell, and Doros N. Theodorou
    Transport Diffusivity of Methane in Silicalite from Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Simulations
    J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 4173-4181

Si27ucEM.mcf
This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py Si27ucEM.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file Si27ucEM.ff in the same directory.

Si27ucEM.xyz
We used this file to start a simulation from an empty zeolite. In that case we use the #Start_Type read_old
This file was crated in two Steps:

Step 1)- Using the Software VMD (Humphrey, W., Dalke, A. and Schulten, K., VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics, J. Molec. Graphics 1996, 14.1, 33-38)

with the following commands:
> vmd Si27ucEM.pdb
> set all [atomselect top all]
> $all writexyz SI27ucEM.xyz

Step 2)- we modifify the Si27ucEM.xyz generated in VMD changing the first line. The first line must have the number of molecules of the zeolite (1) and the number of molecules of adsorbate (0)

methane_Si.inp
You need to prepare the input file for running a short simulation in order to generate the Fragment files for both components (the zeolite and the methane).

 However, you maybe can come across with some doubts filling some required information. Here we are going to explain some of then:

# Box_Info
number of boxes = 1 
Box geometry = solid geometry (MFI has orthorhombic geometry then the box is ORTHOGONAL)
dimensions of the box = dimensions of your "supercell" (here we used 3x3x3 then de size in x=60.21 y=59.76 and z=40.26)

# Chemical_Potential_Info
This keyword "Chemical_Potential_Info" sets the chemical potential of the insertable species in the order in which they appear in the # Molecule_Files
The chemical potentials will be set arbitrarily to zero for species that cannot be swapped or exchanged with a reservoir. 
Therefore you need to enter just the chemical potential of the adsorbate. A proper value wich agrees with the pressure in the fluid phase is previously got from an independent GCMC simulation for the fluid phase


Now you are ready to  obtain the Fragment_Files. 
species1/ and species2/
    These directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane_Si.inp Si27ucEM.pdb CH4.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane_Si.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named methane_Si.*, as defined in the input file. 
We did not provided the LOG file for this example, since due to the size of the supercell (7776 atoms) the 
file is too big (around 3 GB). When you run your simulation be sure to have enough space.

Please see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
