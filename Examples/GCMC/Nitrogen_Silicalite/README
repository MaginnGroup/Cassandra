This directory contains all the information to create the files needed to run a short simulation of 
adsorption of nitrogen (from the gas phase) in Silicalite at temperature T=77K and P=0.0026bar. 
In that pressure and temperature nitrogen has a chemical potential of -10 kJ/mol (from a previous GCMC simulation in gas phas)

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1. For the adsorbate: Nitrogen
N23S.pdb
    created in Gaussview
    The  three site model was considered. 
    In this model a “dumb” atom with a charge twice bigger then the charge considered for the nitrogen, 
    is placed between the 2 Nitrogen atoms. 
    We call this model  nitrogen 3 sites (N23S). This model is avalilable in:
    Murthy, C. S.; Singer, K.; Klein, M. L.; McDonald, I. R. 
    Mol. Phys. 41, 1387 (1980)  

N23S.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py N23S.pdb --ffTemplate
   
    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. 
    The parameters used to the nitrogen 3 sites  are available in the following 
    publication:
    Pottof, J.J and J. I. Siepmann
    Vapor–liquid equilibria of mixtures containing alkanes, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen
    AIChE journal, 47, 1676-1682 (2001) 

N23S.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py N23S.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file N23S.ff in the same directory.

I.2. For the adsorbent: Silicalite
MFI.pdb
A CIF file was dowloaded  from the Database of Zeolite Structure (http://www.iza-structure.org/databases/).
 
The PDB file was created using VESTA following the steps bellow:

Step 1:
In the file menu: 
click Open... and then download our CIF file: MFI.cif

Step 2:
In the Objects menu:
click Boundary... and then fill the Ranges for the fractional coordinates according the size you want. 
•In this example we used a unit cell. Then the ranges in x, y and z should be 0 to 1. The unit cell contains 288 atoms

Step 3:
In the file menu:
click Export Data... and then choose the name of the file with pdb extension: MFI.pdb 

MFI.ff
An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py MFI.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used for the Si and O atoms  are available in the following reference:
    Konstantinos Makrodimitris, George K. Papadopoulos, and Doros N. Theodorou
    Prediction of Permeation Properties of CO2 and N2 through Silicalite via Molecular Simulations
    J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 777-788

MFI.mcf
This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py MFI.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file MFI.ff in the same directory.

MFI.xyz
We used this file to start a simulation from an empty zeolite. In that case we use the #Start_Type Read_old
This file was crated in two Steps:

Step 1)- Using the Software VMD (Humphrey, W., Dalke, A. and Schulten, K., VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics, J. Molec. Graphics 1996, 14.1, 33-38)

with the following commands:
> vmd MFI.pdb
> set all [atomselect top all]
> $all writexyz MFI.xyz

Step 2)- We modifify the MFI.xyz generated in VMD changing the first line. The first line must have the number of molecules of 
the zeolite (1) and the number of molecules of nitrogen (0)

I.3. The input file
nitrogen_Si.inp
You need to prepare the input file for running a short simulation in order to generate the Fragment files for both components:
the zeolite and the nitrogen.

You maybe can come across with some doubts filling some required information. Here we are going to explain some of then:

# Box_Info
number of boxes = 1 
Box geometry = solid geometry (MFI has orthorhombic geometry then the box is ORTHOGONAL)
Dimensions of the box = dimensions of your "zeolite" . Here we used a single unit cell then, x= 20.09, y=19.738 and  z=13.142 Angs.

# Chemical_Potential_Info
This keyword "Chemical_Potential_Info" sets the chemical potential of the insertable species in the order in which they appear 
in the # Molecule_Files.
The chemical potentials will be set arbitrarily to zero for species that cannot be swapped or exchanged with a reservoir. 
Therefore, you need to enter just the chemical potential of the adsorbate. A proper value wich agrees with the pressure 
in the fluid phase was previously got from an independent GCMC simulation for the fluid phase


Now you are ready to  obtain the Fragment_Files. 
species1/ and species2/
    These directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nitrogen_Si.inp MFI.pdb N23S.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nitrogen_Si.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nitrogen_Si.*, as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
