This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
gas-phase methane at temperature T=300K and chemical potential of -35kJ/mol.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION


CH4.pdb 
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

CH4.ff 
    A empty templates were created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

CH4.mcf 
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb

    Note that this command requires the  CH4.ff file  must be in the same directory.

methane.inp
    In order to have an idea about the value of the chemical potential at a given temperature(T) and pressure (P)
     you can start from the expression for monoatomic gas (Hill, An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics (1960)):

       mu(T,P) = -kB T ln[(2*Pi*m*kB*T/h^2)^3/2] +kB*Tln(P)

    were kB is the Boltlzmann Constant, m is the mass of the one molecule and h the Planck Constant.
    Take care with the units!!! The quantity in brackets has dimension of pressure. 
    The chemical potential (mu) must be in kJ/mol.
    
    probablilites used in this example are:
    translations
    rotation
    insertions and deletions
    All the moviments were taken with equally probability.

    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane.inp CH4.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named methane* , as defined in the input file. Please 

see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
