This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
nitrogen in gas phase, at temperature T=77K and chemical potential of -7kJ/mol.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

N23S.pdb
    created in Gaussview
    The  three site model was considered. 
    In this model a “dumb” atom with a charge twice bigger then the charge considered for the nitrogen, 
    is placed between the 2 Nitrogen atoms. 
    We call this model  nitrogen 3 sites (N23S). This model is avalilable in:
    Murthy, C. S.; Singer, K.; Klein, M. L.; McDonald, I. R. 
    Mol. Phys. 41, 1387 (1980)  

N23S.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py N23S.pdb --ffTemplate
   
    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. 
    The parameters used to the nitrogen 3 sites  are available in the following 
    publication:
    Pottof, J.J and J. I. Siepmann
    Vapor–liquid equilibria of mixtures containing alkanes, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen
    AIChE journal, 47, 1676-1682 (2001) 

N23S.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py N23S.pdb --solid

    Note that this command requires the file N23S.ff in the same directory.

nitrogen.inp
    In order to have an idea about the value of the chemical potential at a given temperature(T) and pressure (P)
     you can start from the expression for monoatomic gas (Hill, An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics, 1960):

       mu(T,P) = -kB T ln[(2*Pi*m*kB*T/h^2)^3/2] +kB*Tln(P)

    were kB is the Boltlzmann Constant, m is the mass of the one molecule and h is the Planck Constant.
    Take care with the units!!! The quantity in brackets has dimension of pressure. 
    The chemical potential (mu) must be in kJ/mol.
    
    probablilites used in this example are:
    translations
    rotation
    insertions and deletions
    All the moviments were taken with equally probability.

    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nitrogen.inp N23S.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nitrogen.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nitrogen.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
