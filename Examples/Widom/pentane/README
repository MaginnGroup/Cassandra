This directory contains the files needed to perform Widom insertions of 
pentane in the trajectory snapshots generated by the NPT pentane example.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

pentane.mcf
    This file was taken from the NPT pentane example.

pentane_widom.inp
    This input file uses the pregen sim type to read trajectory snapshots 
    previously generated by the NPT pentane example simulation.

    9000 Widom insertions are performed on each snapshot.  The Widom insertions
    for each snapshot are split into 3 Widom insertion subgroups.

    Atom type pair-specific (adaptive) overlap radii based on Emax = 300.0 are used, 
    and recommended Emax estimation is enabled. Atom pair-specific (specific) 
    overlap radius estimation is enabled with three tolerances.

    CBMC trial energies are estimated from a precomputed energy table.

    Thermodynamic properties are output for each trajectory snapshot.

pentane_traj.H
    This file contains box size and number of molecules for each species in
    each frame, and is copied from NPT/pentane/equil.out.H in the example directory.

pentane_traj.xyz
    This file contains atom coordinates for each frame, and is copied from 
    NPT/pentane/equil.out.xyz in the example directory.
    
species1/
    This directory was copied from NPT/pentane/species1/ in the example directory.

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe pentane_widom.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named pentane_widom.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra documentation for more information on each output file type.
