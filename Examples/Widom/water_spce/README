This directory contains the files needed to perform Widom insertions of 
water in the trajectory snapshots generated by the NPT water_spce example.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

spce.mcf
    This file was taken from the NPT water_spce example.

spce_widom.inp
    This input file uses the pregen sim type to read trajectory snapshots 
    previously generated by the NPT water_spce example simulation.

    9000 Widom insertions are performed on each snapshot.  The Widom insertions
    for each snapshot are split into 6 Widom insertion subgroups.

    Thermodynamic properties are output for each trajectory snapshot.

spce_traj.H
    This file contains box size and number of molecules for each species in
    each frame, and is copied from NPT/water_spce/npt.out.H in the example directory.

spce_traj.xyz
    This file contains atom coordinates for each frame, and is copied from 
    NPT/water_spce/npt.out.xyz in the example directory.
    
species1/
    This directory was copied from NPT/water_spce/species1/ in the example directory.

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe spce_widom.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named spce_widom.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra documentation for more information on each output file type.
