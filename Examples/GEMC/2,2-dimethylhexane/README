This directory contains all the files needed to run a short Gibbs Ensemble
simulation of 2,2-dimethylhexane at temperature T=354K.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

dimethylhexane.pdb
    created in Gaussview. Alternatively, this file can be created by hand, Avogadro
    or obtained online.

dimethylhexane.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dimethylhexane.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TraPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TraPPE parameters for methane are available in the following 
    publication:

      M.G. Martin, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Novel configurational-bias Monte Carlo method for branched molecules. 
            Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 2. 
            United-atom description of branched alkanes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 103, 4508-4517 (1999).

dimethylhexane.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py dimethylhexane.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file dimethylhexane.ff in the same directory.

gemc_dimethylhexane.inp
    The initial density for the liquid and vapor phases were chosen to be close
    to the final density reported by Martin et al.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe gemc_dimethylhexane.inp dimethylhexane.pdb

\Init_Config\nvt_liq.xyz
\Init_Config\nvt_vap.xyz

    This files were created by running a previous NVT simulation of each box. The conditions of these runs are
    consistent with the initial conditions of the GEMC simulation (i.e. same box sizes, same temperature, etc).

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe gemc_dimethylhexane.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named gemc_dimethylhexane.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
