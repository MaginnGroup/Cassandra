This directory contains all the files needed to run a short Gibbs Ensemble
simulation of diethylether at temperature T=354K.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

diethylether.pdb
    created in Gaussview. Alternatively, this file can be created by hand, Avogadro
    or obtained online.

diethylether.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py diethylether.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TraPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. TraPPE parameters for methane are available in the following 
    publication:

      J.M. Stubbs, J.J. Potoff, and J.I. Siepmann,
      Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 
	    6. United-atom description for ethers, glycols, ketones and aldehydes
      J. Phys. Chem. B, 108, 17596-17605 (2004).

diethylether.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py diethylether.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file diethylether.ff in the same directory.

gemc_diethylether.inp
    The initial density for the liquid and vapor phases were chosen to be close
    to the final density reported by Stubbs et al.

species1/
    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe gemc_diethylether.inp diethylether.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe gemc_diethylether.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named gemc_diethylether.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
