This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
gas-phase pentane at temperature T=336K and pressure P=3.38bar.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

pentane.pdb
    created in Gaussview

pentane.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py pentane.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters from the TRAPPE forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
		template. TRAPPE parameters for pentane are available in the following 
		publication:

	    M.G. Martin, and J.I. Siepmann,
	    Transferable potentials for phase equilibria. 1. United-atom description 
			of n-alkanes
	    J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998).

pentane.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py pentane.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file pentane.ff in the same directory.

nvt.inp
    The initial volume was chosen to be slightly less than ideal gas volume

		   V.ideal = N kB T / P = 200 * kB * 336K / 3.38 bar = (140 A)^3

		The move probabilities were selected such that 1 volume move, which 
		requires (N=200)^2 pairwise energy calculations, is attempted every 
		N=200 molecule moves. The probability of a volume move is 1/201. The 
		three types of molecule moves--translation, rotation, and regrowth--
		are equally probable, 200/201/3.

		Thermodynamic properties are then output every 10 sweeps = 2010 moves.

    This directory was created with the following command:

		> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe equil.inp pentane.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe equil.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named equil.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.

equil.out.box1.prp1 contains 100 entries. equil.out.box1.H and 
equil.out.box1.xyz each contain one additional entry at time t=0
because the inital configuration was generated using the make_config option.
