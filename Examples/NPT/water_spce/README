This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation of 
liquid-phase water using the SPC/E model with N=600 molecules at temperature 
T=300K and pressure P=1.0bar.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

spce.mcf
    This file was created by modifying spc.mcf.

    Parameters from the SPC/E forcefield were manually typed into the blank 
    template. Parameters for SPC/E are available in the following 
    publication:

			H. J. C. Berendsen, J. R. Grigera, and T. P. Straatsma. 
			The Missing Term in Effective Pair Potentials. 
			J. Phys. Chem 1987, 91, 6269-6271.

npt.inp
    This input file uses the checkpoint option. It reads the volume, maximum
		displacement for translations, maximum theta for rotations and molecule 
		coordinates from the nvt.inp.chk file.

    The move probabilities were selected such that 1 volume move, which 
    requires (N=600)^2 pairwise energy calculations, is attempted every 
    N=600 molecule moves. The probability of a volume move is 1/601.
    The two types of molecule moves--translation and rotation--are equally
    probable 600/601/2. Regrowth moves are not needed because water is a 
		rigid molecule.

    Thermodynamic properties are output every 10 sweeps = 6010 moves, for a
		total of 100 sweeps.

npt.inp.chk
    This checkpoint file was created by running 50k sweeps in the NPT ensemble,
		at N=600 molecules, P=1.0bar, and T=300K.

    This directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe nvt.inp spce.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe nvt.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named nvt.out.* , as defined in the input file. Please 
see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
