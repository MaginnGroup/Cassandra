This directory contains the files necessary to run a short Widom insertion simulation 
in Cassandra using a trajectory generated in LAMMPS.  The simulation computes the 
shifted chemical potential of R-32 (difluoromethane) in pure BMIM-PF6 (an ionic liquid).
The Widom insertions performed in each trajectory frame are split into five subgroups.
The cell list-based overlap detection is enabled to accelerate the simulation.
Atom pair-specific overlap radii are used and set with bmim_pf6_r32.rminsq.
There are two simulation input files provided, bmim_pf6_r32_read_xyz.inp and 
bmim_pf6_r32_read_xtc.inp.  The former reads the trajectory frames from a .xyz file
and a .H file, while the latter reads the trajectory frames from bmim-pf6.xtc instead.

The bash script convert_trajectory.sh shows how to use the python script 
lammpstrjconvert.py to convert the included LAMMPS trajectory (bmim-pf6.lammpstrj) to 
bmim-pf6.H and bmim-pf6.xyz, which are the trajectory files read by Cassandra when 
running bmim_pf6_32_read_xyz.inp.

The trajectory frames stored in bmim-pf6.lammpstrj and bmim-pf6.xtc are the same, 
just in different formats, so both Widom insertion simulations should yield almost
identical results.

BMIM-PF6 is parameterized with GAFF, while the parameters for R-32 
come from the following publication:

      Different Fluoropropenes and Their Binary Mixtures with R-32 and CO2.
