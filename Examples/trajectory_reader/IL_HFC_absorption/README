This directory contains the files necessary to run a short Widom insertion simulation 
in Cassandra using a trajectory generated in LAMMPS.  The simulation computes the 
shifted chemical potential of R-32 (difluoromethane) in pure BMIM-PF6 (an ionic liquid).
The Widom insertions performed in each trajectory frame are split into five subgroups.
The cell list-based overlap detection is enabled to accelerate the simulation.
The bash script convert_trajectory.sh shows how to use the python script 
lammpstrjconvert.py to convert the included LAMMPS trajectory (bmim-pf6.lammpstrj) to 
bmim-pf6.H and bmim-pf6.xyz, which are the trajectory files read by Cassandra.

BMIM-PF6 is parameterized with the GAFF, while the parameters for R-32 
come from the following publication:

      Gabriele Raabe.
      Molecular Dynamics Studies on Liquid-Phase Dynamics and Structures of Four 
      Different Fluoropropenes and Their Binary Mixtures with R-32 and CO2.

The parameters for GAFF can be found in the following publication:
