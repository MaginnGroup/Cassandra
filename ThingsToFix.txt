The following things need to be reviewed for future Cassandra versions

1) Methane GCMC simulation Example

I tried to run the Methane example found on the official release 
using my own personal computer and none of the deletion/insertion moves were accepted. 
However, when I tried to run it from maginnfe it ran perfectly.

I dig into the code, and found that there is an variable called  species_list. 
This contains the type species_list(i)%int_species_type, which should be an integer 
and its value is related to labeling a species as SORBATE or NORMAL (i.e. 0 or 1). 

This array is never initialized  at least for a GCMC. If I run in Maginnfe, 
the system automatically and coincidentally sets this to 0 (the correct value) 
and runs without problem. When I run it in my personal computer, 
the system sets it to a random number and the system never identifies the 
methane as a sorbate, setting always its fugacity/chemical pot to 0.

2) MCF_Gen script does not recognize LJ Particles when using CML files

This was fixed and Eliseo has the script. It has not been updated to Github. 
This probably needs more testing though.

3) MCF_Gen script would work better if it uses the 'label' function provided by avogadro.
This would be used to specify the atom type directly from the avogadro GUI. This is not
crucial, but it might be helpful

4) NVT cutoff: There is no warning if one uses cutoff greater than the box length

5) NPT Water Example: it runs  fine for a while, but it crashes with a segmentation fault
