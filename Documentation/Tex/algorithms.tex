\section*{Pair Energy Storage}
Any MC move requires calculation of the change in the energy of the system. This, usually,
means calculation of the energy of the system before and after the move has been 
attempted. For example, in a translation move, atomic positions of a randomly selected
molecule are perturbed. The acceptance rule for this move requires that the energy of the
molecule in old and new configurations is required. If the energy of the molecule in old
state is available, considerable savings in the calculation can be achieved. Cassandra
implments this strategy by storing the interactions between two molecules in an array.
Two arrays are defined: {\bf pair\_nrg\_vdw} and {\bf pair\_nrg\_elec}.
