Funding and resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for this work was provided by a grant from the National Science
Foundation entitled “SI2-SSE: Development of Cassandra, a General, Efficient
and Parallel Monte Carlo Multiscale Modeling Software Platform for
Materials Research”, grant number ACI-1339785.

Ed Maginn would like to acknowledge financial support from Sandia National
Laboratory’s Computer Science Research Institute, which enabled him to take
a research leave and lay the foundation for Cassandra in collaboration with
Jindal Shah, who stayed behind at Notre Dame and helped keep the group going.
The hospitality of Steve Plimpton and co-workers at Sandia is gratefully
acknowledged.

Finally, we would also like to thank the Center for Research Computing at
Notre Dame, which provided support, encouragement, and infrastructure to
help bring Cassandra to life.
