    Overview
    ~~~~~~~~
    
    Cassandra is an open source Monte Carlo software package developed in the
    Maginn group at the University of Notre Dame. It is designed to perform
    atomistic simulations of molecules composed of rings, chains, or both.

    .. Cassandra is suited to compute the thermodynamic properties of fluids
       and phase equilibria. It handles a standard "Class I"-type force field
       having fixed bond lengths. Cassandra uses OpenMP parallelization and
       comes with a number of scripts, utilities and examples to help with
       simulation setup. It is released under the GNU General Public License.
