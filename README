This file describes the layout of the Cassandra distribution directory along 
with instruction on how to compile the code, run examples and set up your first
Cassandra simulation.

After unpacking the Cassandra distribution, the parent Cassandra directory will contain
the following subdirectories:

Documentation
Examples 
Scripts
Src

It will also contain this file and license.txt. The license.txt file
describes the Gnu Public License under which Cassandra is released. By
using Cassandra, you agree to comply with the terms of the
license. Please read it carefully before you use the code. 

The following directories are included in the distribution:


Documentation
------------
Contains the documentation for the code, user_guide.pdf.
You can find most answers to your questions here. 

Examples
--------
This directory contains examples of short Cassandra simulations in 
NVT, NPT, grand canonical and Gibbs ensembles for a number of systems
such as methane, isobutane, 2,2-dimethylhexane, cyclohexane, diethylether,
pentane and the SPC/E model of water. Examples of molecules with varying degrees
of conformational complexity (LJ particles, branch points, ring moieties) and
those requiring computation of electrostatic interactions are included. 
The results from these simulations can also be used to test any modifications 
you make to the code. The examples contain an input file and some
output files. If you run a job using the input file, you will
overwrite the output files. You may wish to copy input and mcf files
to a clean directory and work with them there, and then see if you can
match the results contained in the original example directory.

Scripts
-------
The Cassandra distribution includes a number of python scripts that help in the setup
of a simulation. The use of these scripts is described in the README
files in the Scripts directory.

Src
---
Contains the Cassandra source code.

How to compile Cassandra
------------------------
The Src directory contains a number of Makefile files that can be used to
compile the code using different compilers. At present, Makefiles for the
Intel Fortran Compiler (12.1), gfortran i4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-4) and
Portland group compiler (pgi) (14.6) are included in the distribution. These Makefiles are

Makefile.intel
Makefile.gfortran
Makefile.pgfortran

There is also a generic Makefile that can be used as a template for
creating your own customized makefile. Depending on the architecture
of the machine you are using, you will need to change compilation
options and flags.  Note that to change compiler options appropriate
for your environment, the F90FLAGS line in the Makefiles can be
edited. You can also modify the optimization options to
improve the speed of the code or operate in debug mode.

To compile Cassandra, remove any object files using the 'clean' command

> make clean

The compile the code using the proper makefile 

> make -f makefilename

where 'makefilename' is the name of the particular makefile you wish
to use. If the compilation is successful, an executable will be
created using the name specified by you in the makefile. For example,
if Cassandra is compiled with the original version of Makefile.intel
released with the code, the executable will be 'cassandra_intel.exe'.  
Similarly for the other makefiles,  executables will be generated with names
'cassandra_gfortran.exe' and 'cassandra_pgfortran.exe'. Should you desire to
change the name of the executable produced, simply edit 'EXEC_NAME' in the
corresponding Makefile. Note that compilation with these Makefiles will 
generate an executable that is suitable for running simulations on a single 
core. This is usually done for testing and debugging purposes. 

Cassandra simulations can also be performed on multiple cores on a given
node using openMP. For this purpose, use any of the following Makefiles:

Makefile.intel.openMP ----> cassandra_intel_openMP.exe
Makefile.gfortran.openMP ----> cassandra_gfortran_openMP.exe
Makefile.pgfortran.openMP ----> cassandra_pgfortran_openMP.exe

Before running the openMP enabled executable, the environment variable
OMP_NUM_THREADS will have to be set to the number of cores you want to
run the simulation on. For example, for 12-core simulation, the 
following command is used in tcsh.

> setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 12

Running a Cassandra Simulation
----------------------------
Cassandra requires three input files in order to run. 

1) Input file:
The input file contains contains various parameters to tell Cassandra
what kind of simulation to run and for how long. This file usually
has the '.inp' extension. The user guide in the Documentation
directory explains the format and requirements of the input file. 

2) MCF file:
Cassandra requires a "molecular connectivity file" for each species in
the simulation. These files are identified with the suffix *.mcf. The
MCF file tells Cassandra the connectivity of the species and what the
force field parameters are for intermolecular and intramolecular
interactions. These can be built "by hand", but we also provide a
python script to make this easier and less error prone. There is a
tutorial in the Documentation directory and the Scripts directory also
explains the process of using the scripts to make *.mcf files.

3) Fragment files:
Cassandra builds and reassembles molecules using a fragment-based
approach. Any molecule can be decomposed into a series of fragments,
which are connected to one another via a single dihedral
angle. Before a simulation begins, Cassandra must determine what these
fragments are, and then it generates a library of fragments having
different internal coordinates. The probability distribution of these
different fragments is known and used by Cassandra when performing
regrowth or insertion/deletion or particle swap moves. The fragment files must be created prior
to the simulation. In order to create a fragment file, you must have
an input and MCF file for the simulation. For the set up of fragment libraries,
you will use the python script library_setup.py provided 
in the /Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup directory.

Once these files have been generated, you are ready to run a Cassandra
simulation. For this, the input file name is specified after the cassandra executable
command. For example, if you wish to run a simulation using the input
file 'npt.inp', invoke the command 

>./cassandra_intel.exe npt.inp

This assumes that both the executable file and the input file are in
the current directory.
