  This script sets up the input file <runname>.inp required to run a Cassandra simulation.
 
  Files required before running:
 	MCF files for each species
 
  For a complete input file which would allow the user to immediately run a Cassandra 
  simulation, the fragment files would also be required.
  However, if the fragment files are not yet prepared, the rest of the input file
  may still be created. 

  Files produced:
    <runname>.inp

 
  Usage: python InputFileGUI_v1_1.py
