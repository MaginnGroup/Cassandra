 This script helps the user to restart a simulation using the read_old option.
 It creates N new xyz files, where N is the number of boxes. The location of
 these files is in the current directory. These xyz files are taken from the
 last configuration of the previous simulation.

 The maximum displacements are taken from the CHK file.

 A new inputfile will be created located in the current folder.

 Usage: read_old.py oldinputfile.inp newinputfile.inp

This will create newinputfile.inp based on oldinputfile.inp, but
 substituting the optimized MC displacement values. It will also
 change the simulation Start_Type to read_old, and will specify the
 files from which the configurations are read. It is recommended that
 you edit the newinputfile.inp to change the random number seeds if
 you want to run an independent simulation.
 
 A few notes:

(1) The script will try to load the following files:
        MCF file: it will use the path specified in oldinputfile.inp
        CHK File: it will look for it in the current directory
        XYZ File: it will look for it in the current directory
        H File: it will look for it in the current directory

(2) The script will create the following files whose name will be derived from old run name.
        XYZ_box?.xyz_new: Last configuration created from a previous simulation.
                           The headers of each configuration will be the number of molecules of each species.
        newinputfile.inp: New input file containing new maximum displacements from the CHK file
                          Start_Type set to read_old using the new XYZ_box?.xyz_new files
                          New box sizes taken from CHK File

Note that the ? specifies the box number.
