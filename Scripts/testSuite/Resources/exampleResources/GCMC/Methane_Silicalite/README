This directory contains all the information needed to run a short simulation of 
adsorption of methane (from the gas phase) in Silicalite at T=300K and P=0.3bar. 
The chemical potential was computed from a previous GCMC simulation gas phase methane.

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1.  For the adsorbate: methane
CH4.pdb 
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

CH4.ff 
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

CH4.mcf 
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py CH4.pdb

    Note that this command requires the CH4.ff  must be in the same directory.


I.2. For the adsorbent: Silicalite
SiO2.pdb
    Silicalite is composed of Si and O in a 1:2 ratio. We will use this basic 
    building block of silicalite to define a "molecule" and tell Cassandra that our
    3x3x3 supercall (7776 atoms total) is composed of 2592 "molecules" of SiO2. Alternatively,
    you could define a molecule as having all 7776 atoms and tell Cassandra that you
    only have 1 molecule.

SiO2.ff
    An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py SiO2.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template.
    The parameters used for the Si and O atoms  are available in the following reference:

    Edward J. Maginn, Alexis T. Bell, and Doros N. Theodorou
    Transport Diffusivity of Methane in Silicalite from Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Simulations
    J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 4173-4181

SiO2.mcf
    This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py SiO2.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file SiO2.ff in the same directory.

Si27ucEM.xyz
    A 3x3x3 supercell of silicalite has 7776 atoms.
    Atoms in this file are listed in the order Si, O, O, Si, O, O, ... to match
    the definition of a "molecule" given in the MCF.
    The simulation is initiated from this configuration using the add_to_config keyword.

    The pdb file for the unit cell was taken from the following reference:
    D. H. Olson, G. T. Kokotailo, S. L. Lawton and W. M. Meier
    Crystal Structure and Structure-Related Properties of ZSM-5 
    The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 85, No. 15, 1981

methane_Si.inp
    You need to prepare the input file for running a short simulation in order 
    to generate the fragment files for methane. H

    # Box_Info
    number of boxes = 1 
    Box geometry = solid geometry (MFI has orthorhombic geometry then the box is ORTHOGONAL)
    dimensions of the box = dimensions of your supercell, x=60.21 y=59.76 and z=40.26
    
    # Chemical_Potential_Info
    This keyword "Chemical_Potential_Info" sets the chemical potential of the 
    insertable species in the order in which they appear in the # Molecule_Files
    The chemical potentials will be set arbitrarily to zero for species that 
    cannot be swapped or exchanged with a reservoir. 

    Therefore you need to enter just the chemical potential of the adsorbate. 
    A proper value wich agrees with the pressure in the fluid phase is 
    previously got from an independent GCMC simulation for the fluid phase

    Now you are ready to generate the fragment library for methane.
    These directory was created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane_Si.inp SiO2.pdb CH4.pdb

II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane_Si.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files are named methane_Si.*, as defined in the input file. 
We did not provided the LOG file for this example, since due to the size of the supercell (7776 atoms) the 
file is too big (around 3 GB). When you run your simulation be sure to have enough space.

Please see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
