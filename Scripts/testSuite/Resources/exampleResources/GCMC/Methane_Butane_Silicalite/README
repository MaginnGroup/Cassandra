This directory contains all the files needed to run a short simulation the adsorption of 
 the mixture of methane and butane, at temperature T=300K e P=3.45bar

I. FILES REQUIRED TO RUN THE SIMULATION

I.1.  For the adsorbates: methane and butane
I.1.1 PDB files
CH4.pdb and C4H10.pdb
    created in Gaussview
    The United_Atoms Model was used

I.1.2. ff files
CH4.ff and C4H10.ff
    A empty templates were created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py 'filename".pdb --ffTemplate
   
    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. 
    The parameters used were those from Force field - TraPPE available in
    Martin and Siepmann, J. Phys. Chem. B, 102, 2569-2577 (1998)

I.1.3. mcf files
CH4.mcf and C4H10.mcf
    These files were generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py "filename".pdb

    Note that this command requires the  "ff file"  generated in  I.2  must be in the same directory.

I.2. For the Adsorbent: Silicalite
I.2.1. PDB file 
unitcell.pdb

  The pdb file for the unit cell was taken from the following reference:
     D. H. Olson, G. T. Kokotailo, S. L. Lawton and W. M. Meier
     Crystal Structure and Structure-Related Properties of ZSM-5
     The Journal of Physical Chemistry, Vol. 85, No. 15, 1981

Then VMD was used to create the supercell (3x3x3).

I.2.2. ff File
unitcell.ff
An empty template was created with the following command

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py unitcell.pdb --ffTemplate

    Parameters were manually typed into the blank template. All parameters were set like zero, since
    we used the custom mixing rules in order to provide the Lennard-Jones parameter proposed by: 
    Zhimei Du, George Manos,Thijs J. H. Vlugt and Berend Smit
    Mo1ecuIar SimuIation of Adsorption of Short Linear Alkanes and Their Mixtures in Silicalite
    AiChE Journal, vol 44, No 8, 1756-1764

I.2.3 MCF file
unitcell.mcf
This file was generated with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/MCF_Generation/mcfgen.py unitcell.pdb

    Note that this command requires the file unitcell.ff in the same directory.

I.2.4. XYZ file
unitcell.xyz
We used this file to start a simulation from an empty zeolite. In that case we use the #Start_Type read_old
This file was crated in two Steps:

Step 1)- Using the Software VMD 
       Humphrey, W., Dalke, A. and Schulten, K.
       VMD - Visual Molecular Dynamics
       J. Molec. Graphics 1996, 14.1, 33-38

with the following commands:
> vmd unitcell.pdb
> set all [atomselect top all]
> $all writexyz unitcell.xyz

Step 2)- we modifify the unitcell.xyz generated in VMD changing the first line. 
The first line must have the number of molecules of the zeolite (1) and the number of molecules of both adsorbates (0  0)

I.3 Input File
methane_butane_Si.inp
You need to prepare the input file for running a short simulation in order to generate the Fragment files for the 
three components (the zeolite and for both adsorbates: methane and butane).

Some details about the input file:

# Box_Info
number of boxes = 1
Box geometry = solid geometry (MFI has orthorhombic geometry then the box is ORTHOGONAL)
Dimensions of the box = dimensions of your "supercell" (here we used 3x3x3. Then the box size is x=60.21 y=59.76 and z=40.26)

# Chemical_Potential_Info
     This keyword "Chemical_Potential_Info" sets the chemical potential of the insertable species in the order in which 
     they appear in the # Molecule_Files
     The chemical potentials will be set arbitrarily to zero for the zeolite. Therefore you just need to enter 
     just the chemical potential for both adsorbates 
     The value of chemical potential of each one of the adsorbates. Therefore, the behaviour of the mixture in the gas 
     phase need to be evaluate in a previous simulation.

    The chemical potential (mu) must be in kJ/mol.
    
    probablilites used in this example are:
    translations
    rotation
    regrowth
    insertions and deletions
    All the moviments were taken with equally probability.

# Mixing_Rule
  In this example we used the values proposed by Du et al (1998).(complete reference in I.2.2)
  There are 2 atoms types in the  Silicalite (SI_s1 and O_s1); 1 atom type in the methane (C4_s2) and 2 atoms types in butane (C3_s3 and C2_s3). 
  Parameters for each pair of atom types must be entered:
     
   SI_s1 SI_s1    0.00   0.0
   SI_s1 O_s1     0.00   0.0
   SI_s1 C4_s2    0.00   0.0
   SI_s1 C3_s3    0.00   0.0
   SI_s1 C2_s3    0.00   0.0
   O_s1  O_s1     0.00   0.0
   O_s1  C4_s2   96.50   3.6
   O_s1  C3_s3   80.00   3.6
   O_s1  C2_s3   58.00   3.6
   C4_s2 C4_s2  148.00   3.73
   C4_s2 C3_s3  120.49   3.75
   C4_s2 C2_s3   83.40   3.83
   C3_s3 C3_s3   98.10   3.77
   C3_s3 C2_s3   67.90   3.85
   C2_s3 C2_s3   47.0    3.93

I.4 Fragment info files
species1/  species2/ ans species3/
    These directories were created with the following command:

    > $CASSANDRA_DIR/Scripts/Frag_Library_Setup/library_setup.py $CASSANDRA_DIR/cassandra.exe methane_butane_Si.inp unitcell.pdb 
        CH4.pdb C4H10.pdb
    
     Note that like butane has two fragments the directory species3/ presents 2 directories: frag1/ and frag2/


II. RUNNING THE SIMULATION

The simulation can be run with the following command:

> $CASSANDRA_DIR/Src/cassandra.exe methane_butane_Si.inp

III. OUTPUT FILES

All output files present the same name atributed in # Run_Name = methane_butane_Si.out.*  

Please see the Cassandra manual for more information on each output file type.
