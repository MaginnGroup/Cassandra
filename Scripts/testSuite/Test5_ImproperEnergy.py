# This is Test 1 in a series of tests for a testSuite in order to check updates made to the Cassandra program. 
# Test 1 is an energy test which tests the starting energies for a molecule using the Lennard-Jones equation. This test does not perform any moves in the Cassandra program, it is simply an initial testing of energy. 
# Test 1 - Checks the starting energy for 4 different scenarios.

# This first subtest runs Cassandra with two molecules in a box of length 100, with the two molecules at a distance of sigma apart. Sigma in this case is 1.0 and epsilon is 120.0. The energy output here should match the Energy output of subtest 2, this is how we will check the accuracy of this test later on in this script.
